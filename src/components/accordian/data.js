        question: 'What are the key differences between renewable and non-renewable energy sources?',
        answer: "The key differences between renewable and non-renewable energy sources lie in their availability and environmental impact. Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal, are replenished naturally and are sustainable over the long term. They produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions, making them environmentally friendly. Non-renewable energy sources, like coal, oil, natural gas, and nuclear power, are finite and can deplete over time. They often contribute to environmental pollution and climate change due to the release of carbon dioxide and other pollutants during their extraction and use."

        question: 'How does the process of photosynthesis in plants contribute to the carbon cycle?',
        answer: "Photosynthesis is a crucial part of the carbon cycle. During photosynthesis, plants absorb carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the atmosphere and use sunlight to convert it into glucose and oxygen. This process not only provides energy for the plants to grow but also removes CO₂ from the atmosphere, helping to regulate the Earth's climate. The glucose produced is used by the plant for energy and growth, and when animals eat plants, they obtain this stored energy. Additionally, when plants and animals die and decompose, the carbon is returned to the soil or released back into the atmosphere, continuing the cycle."
